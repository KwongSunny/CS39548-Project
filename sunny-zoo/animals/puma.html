    "Puma is a genus in the family Felidae whose only extant species is the cougar
    (also known as the puma and mountain lion, among other names), and may also
    include several poorly known Old World fossil representatives (for example,
    Puma pardoides, or Owen's panther, a large, cougar-like cat of Eurasia's 
    Pliocene).[2][3] In addition to these potential Old World fossils, a few New 
    World fossil representatives are possible, such as Puma pumoides[4] and the 
    two species of the so-called "American cheetah", currently classified under 
    the genus Miracinonyx.[5]" -Wikipedia
