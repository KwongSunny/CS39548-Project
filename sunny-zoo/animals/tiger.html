    "The tiger (Panthera tigris) is the largest living cat species and a
    member of the genus Panthera. It is most recognisable for its dark 
    vertical stripes on orange fur with a white underside. An apex predator, 
    it primarily preys on ungulates such as deer and wild boar. It is 
    territorial and generally a solitary but social predator, requiring 
    large contiguous areas of habitat, which support its requirements for 
    prey and rearing of its offspring. Tiger cubs stay with their mother 
    for about two years, then become independent and leave their mother's 
    home range to establish their own." -Wikipedia
