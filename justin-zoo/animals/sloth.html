    "Sloths are a group of arboreal Neotropical xenarthran mammals, 
    constituting the suborder Folivora. Noted for their slowness of 
    movement, they spend most of their lives hanging upside down in 
    the trees of the tropical rainforests of South America and Central 
    America. They are considered to be most closely related to anteaters, 
    together making up the xenarthran order Pilosa.

    There are six extant sloth species in two genera – Bradypus 
    (three–toed sloths) and Choloepus (two–toed sloths). Despite this 
    traditional naming, all sloths actually have three toes on each rear 
    limb, although two-toed sloths have only two digits on each forelimb. 
    The two groups of sloths are from different, distantly related families, 
    and are thought to have evolved their morphology via parallel evolution 
    from terrestrial ancestors. Besides the extant species, many species of 
    ground sloths ranging up to the size of elephants (like Megatherium) 
    inhabited both North and South America during the Pleistocene Epoch." -Wikipedia
