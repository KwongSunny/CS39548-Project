    "Gorillas are herbivorous, predominantly ground-dwelling 
    great apes that inhabit the tropical forests of equatorial Africa. 
    The genus Gorilla is divided into two species: the eastern gorilla 
    and the western gorilla, and either four or five subspecies. 
    The DNA of gorillas is highly similar to that of humans, from 95 
    to 99% depending on what is included, and they are the next closest 
    living relatives to humans after chimpanzees and bonobos. Gorillas 
    are the largest living primates, reaching heights between 1.25-1.8 
    metres, weights between 100–270 kg, and arm spans up to 2.6 metres, 
    depending on species and sex. They tend to live in troops, with 
    the leader being called a silverback. The Eastern gorilla is 
    distinguished from the Western by darker fur colour and 
    some other minor morphological differences. Gorillas tend to live 
    35–40 years in the wild." -Wikipedia
