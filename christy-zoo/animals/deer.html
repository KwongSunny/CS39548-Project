    "Deer or true deer are hoofed ruminant mammals forming the family Cervidae. 
    The two main groups of deer are the Cervinae, including the muntjac, the elk (wapiti),
    the red deer, and the fallow deer; and the Capreolinae, including the reindeer (caribou),
     white-tailed deer, the roe deer, and the moose. Male deer of all species (except the Chinese water deer) 
     as well as female reindeer, grow and shed new antlers each year. In this they differ from 
     permanently horned antelope, which are part of a different family (Bovidae) within the 
     same order of even-toed ungulates (Artiodactyla)." - wikipedia
